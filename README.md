# aDF for Turtle WoW
aDF adds a small HUD that standardizes critical info about your target's defences, including Armor, ~~Resists~~, and specific debuffs. This HUD should be useful to all DPS and Tank players who would play differently depending on the state of their enemy's defenses and vulnerabilities.

## Features
* The HUD displays your current PVE target's armor and debuffs.
* As enemy and friendly players' armor values are not exposed to the API by vmangos servers, the armor reading will not work in PVP. 
* Hold Shift and left click to drag and move the HUD.
* Right click the armor reading to share the value with others, or right click a debuff to announce if its up or not. 
* Type `/adf options` to configure which debuffs are shown for you, and which chat channel announcements are made in.
